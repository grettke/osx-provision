        older versions of iOS or macOS) can install Xcode via the App Store.

- Utility Scripts
  - Mount only required volumes
    - Clarify
      - Spotlight suggests applications and files on those volumes and
        you usually don't want that
      - Applications get locks on files on non host volumes
    - For =host1= that means =host1= and =Storage=
    - Write a shell script and run it at logon
      - Customize this for the install partition
      - These scripts live in my personal =util= directory
