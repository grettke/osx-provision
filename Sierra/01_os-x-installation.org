      - If you are on the /latest/ version of macOS then you
        *can only install latest version of Xcode* from the App Store. If you have
        absolutely no requirements either for internal use (like specific versions
        of development tools or accessibility tools) or external (support specific
        older versions of iOS or macOS) can install Xcode via the App Store.
      - If you are on a previous version of your tech stack then you may download
        Xcode manually [[https://developer.apple.com/download/more/][here]]. .

- Utility Scripts
  - Mount only required volumes
    - Clarify
      - Spotlight suggests applications and files on those volumes and
        you usually don't want that
      - Applications get locks on files on non host volumes
    - For =host1= that means =host1= and =Storage=
    - Write a shell script and run it at logon
      - Customize this for the install partition
      - These scripts live in my personal =util= directory
