** Literate DevOps: OS X Development System

Setting up a development system is a non-trivial investment.

This document captures the steps required and automates as much as possible.

The Style Guide is a *must read* for the operator.

[[http://orgmode.org/][Org-Mode]] converted this manual, tedious, and error prone task to a
semi-automated, nearly reproducible, and error-less process, for /me/. This document
has never been beta tested; I am it's *only* user.

* Style Guide

  :ID:       STYLEGUIDE
  :END:

- The means justify the ends
  - Makes entirety of the effort achievable, sensible, and valuable
- Be ready for surprises
  - You will learn new things every run
  - You will be surprised by things every run
  - You have to decide if it is an opportunity to better things or
    it is something to get upset about
    - Only you may decide
- Each top level section might be completed in entirety
  - Take brakes between them
  - Take over-night breaks
  - The whole thing takes a while
- Right-click to paste text into the terminal
  - If you Pretzel-v it, it doesn' work right
- Make scripts executable and run them
  - =sh= doesn' do what you want and you always forget that
- If one of your purchased apps doesn' show up in AppStore then just buy it again
  - The store will detect that you already own it and ask you to install it
  - Growl always has this problem
  - Used to reboot to fix it, but unreliable
- This whole thing only makes sense when you read each line
  - Partially because you forget after not doing it for a while
  - The order is critical
  - A lot of the steps are automated and only make sense after you understand
    the entire script
  - There are still a lot of manual steps though
  - For example automate app installs and manually configure them, *before* moving
    on to the next section
  - Everything must be completed before moving on to the next thing
- Disk image verification
  - Recipes exist to disable it
  - I don't use them; I want to know every time that all of my disk images are
    in a known good state
- Try running every program
  - Only way to identify failures
  - Only way to automate the correct way
  - Continue to find new issues and fixes
- Total transparency
  - I've run this 7 times already
  - Every time I run it I find new bugs and new improvements
  - Provisioning reveals just how much
    - One doesn't know about their OS
    - Things can go really well despite the fact we don't know how to do it
      right
- Automated provisioning is handled by [[https://github.com/grettke/kitchenplan][kitchenplan]]
- Be thoughtful
  - This is not unique to this box, I just always forget
  - For example when I install Emacs
    - I didn't think about using the main GNU release versus railwaycat's
      - That was dumb because I didn't think about the implications
    - First time, I installed all additional libraries
      - That was dumb because you should only install what you specifically need
    - Brew
      - It is very easy to use Brew
      - It will install a lot of stuff to make you happy
      - If you don't pay attention to what it does to make you happy then it
        will eventually make you unhappy
- Only run this setup with a reliable high-speed Internet connection
  - Ran this at off-site, and 40% of the downloads failed
- Once you get comfortable a couple of things happen
  - You try to paralellize stuff to save time and it is a big mistake which
    totally defeats the purpose of taking it slowly and easy because inevitably
    you will make mistakes
  - You forget that the means justify the ends; take it slowly and easy and
    perform the steps in that manner
  - You will form an opinion based upon experience rather than fantasy
    - Everyone is entitled to an opinion
    - Some opinions are more valuable then others
    - Experience trumps fantasy *every* time
    - Take this dev-ops task as an opportunity to form your own
      personal-preference
    - Valuable opinions come about as a result of a lot of good learning

  - I suspect though that if I don't specify it here, then at some point I will
    either copy or move this passage of text, and since it does not mention the
    desired file system (MOSEJ), that it will result in a documentation bug
  - When you do this, specify the FS and MOSEJ

The OSX file system is somewhat-case-sensitive. I did not choose a
case-sensitive operating system when I installed it. If you run =r= or =R= then
OSX will start R. However, if you run an alias with the same name but upper
versus lower case then it will execute the correct alias. I learned this today.
This is why there are two aliases for starting =R=; I want a more OSX like
behavior. I am curious about having a Mac-like console.

I want Xcode. I want the CLT. I want the IDE and more. I also want KitchenPlan.
The installation order of these things was not obvious to me. I got it wrong 3
times. Now it works correctly. Install Xcode and then CLT and then everyone
seems to be happy.

Go to the App Store and install it.

You must start Xcode and agree to its licensing. Afterwards, close it.

For reference, see where it lives.

Now install the CLT. Choose *Install*.

#+NAME: FF74308C-81D1-4F13-8CF9-83674BFC5F18
#+begin_src sh
xcode-select --install
#+end_src

Note here that the Xcode path does not change. I don't understand this. What I
think is happening is that Xcode is installed and that it is providing
everything that is required and CLT piggy-backs on it.

Install DeltaWalker.

Previously I used Meld. That worked fine. It was in Python. Brew installed it's
own Python. I didn't like that. That is why I switched to DiffMerge. I didn't
want to install Brew Python in addition to OSX Python. Personal preference.

Previously I used DiffMerge. It didn't have block-merge. That is why I switched
to DeltaWalker.

My old setup had a problem. In Git I set up the external.diff to Meld.
external.diff is only for command line tools. Meld is a GUI. That was wrong.
I got a poor-user experience with git and vc-diff and Magit as a result.

This is the first BrewCask install, so it asks you for your password.

There are a lot of ways to manage libraries for Python. There are also many ways
to manage Python installations. I am not considering any of them here. My
approach is to use the base-box as a base. It needs to do certain things well.
These directions are for my current approach.

Log in and out again to see changes. Previously I would reboot the machine, but
that seems unnecessary.

The first two times I tested this, the desktop picture was set correctly. The
3rd time it was not. Also 4-6. I'm leaving that alone for now.

KitchenPlan may be run repeatedly. After completing various sections of this
script I re-ran KitchenPlan. It worked correctly.

This is what it takes to get an Emacs+Org development environment set up.
Nearly everything is included but for LaTeX, which has an enormous download
and installed by hand later.

The way that I like to go through this is to:
- Perform the steps in the manual section
- Execute =emacs-run.sh= for the automated stuff
- Perform the manual configuration for everything that got installed
  - Directions are in =emacs-read.org=

Manually install fonts used for Emacs.

Fonts that will be installed:
- DejaVu
- NotoSans
- NotoSansSymbols
- Quivira
- Symbola

They live in the font dir in the ALEC project.

Steps to install them:
- Extract them
- Start Font Book
- Create a new COLLECTION "Emacs"
- Drag the top-level  directory into the collection
  - Font Book will search through it recursively for fonts and add them
- Correct any resolution issues, which happen every time so far

Why is this here? It used to be for Meld. Meld went away. It definitely /feels/
right to be here. It is nice to have a X-Server. Stuff like the =dot= tool
use X. I am staying true-enough here.

This install asks for a password. I am done researching what asks for a password
and what does not. Perfect world I would do that and break out the steps into
things that ask for a password and things that to do not. In that perfect world,
time does not exist. To do this in a world with time will take a lot of it.

Asking for passwords appears to be an application-specific event and not based
on order of Brew and BrewCask installs. Even if there is more to it, I am not
researching it more now.

I quit using railwaycat's emacs mac port. It was really nice. One night I
reprovisionined my machine. railwaycat's repo was down. I learned that it was a
one-man show. I never thought about it. It means that it is not supported well.
Things that are supported well are likely to be available. I switched to the
GNU Emacs app. It has those desirable traits.

ImageMagic is required for the Emacs install, so install it first.

#+NAME: 49CABBF3-4E91-47A3-9A84-EFE55DDCC9FD
#+begin_src sh :tangle emacs-run.sh :comments no

#+begin_src sh :tangle emacs-run.sh :comments no
brew install emacs --cocoa --with-gnutls --with-imagemagick
brew linkapps
#+end_src

The installer lists caveats. Do I need to know of these for each installer???

Now link my .emacs.el and try tangling.

The eshell config lives under .emacs.d. It doesn't exist until Emacs is run.
This setup creates a link to the real .emacs.d. Create the directory first and
then link it.

* Productivity Semi-Automated
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       F448220B-7657-44BE-96BE-66D4A82DCAD9
  :END:

To be immediately productive with the most common use cases, I need all of
these apps.

Use cases:

- Communications
- Productivity
- Word processing
- Productivity is pretty broadly defined here. It means everything.

The installation process is similar to Emacs up above:

- Install the software automatically
- Configure it manually
- Manually run it and make sure that it is happy
  - You will find new stuff every time you do this and you will get better at
    dev-ops and automate as much of it as you can and want to do

I am curious about how best to automate this portion of the installation. My
approaches were in order:

- Just let it run and try stuff later
  - Allows for installation failures which I don't like, it wastes time
    discovering the issue and resolving it
- Verify that each app starts
  - This is a fine approach. I would like to know at installation time though if
    there is a failure. Reading the transcript would be a good approach. Perhaps
    I should capture it, too.
  - Works easily for command line stuff via a script. GUI stuff is slower when
    I run it through Spotlight. Perhaps it is worth tracking down the
    installation directories of everything and starting them up via =open=?
    - Is this level of reproducibility required? Might need to quantify this.

Read through the installation messages at least once. You will learn things and
then you will improve the installation process.

This is the first BrewCask install where I saw a check-sum error:

The software was downloaded. Its check-sum was wrong. Now what? This isn't the
end of the world. I am glad it reported it. I am not investigating the mismatch.
I suspect that there is a newer release and the formula wasn't updated. That is
fine. I will delete that download and install it manually. This is a story I
want to capture. Things aren't always perfect. There are so many moving parts
that this is bound to happen. Patches are usually always welcomed, too.

To handle this manual install, I read the OSX page for R. They explain that
we ought to compare the check-sum of the download and show how. The current
hashes are:

#+begin_example
MD5-hash: 2f263bbb394361b5c3dd0d882d1d2e70

Install the VMWare provider for Vagrant and then license it.

Remember to [[http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/other/debugging.html][log]] appropriately.

It goes something like this:

,#+begin_src sh
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vmware-fusion
mkdir ~/.vagrant
cd ~/.vagrant
# copy that license file in there
vagrant plugin license vagrant-vmware-fusion license.lic
cd
rm -rf ~/.vagrant
,#+end_src

Verify the plugin is licensed and happy:

,#+NAME: CCCFA8CD-1754-4BD6-A355-7907E885B6C4
,#+BEGIN_SRC sh
vagrant plugin list
,#+END_SRC

Test out VirtualBox box:

,#+begin_src sh
cd ~/tmp
mkdir vgtest
cd vgtest
vagrant init hashicorp/precise64
vagrant up --provider virtualbox
,#+end_src

The first time I tried this, it failed. I restarted OSX. Then it worked.

Test out VMWare. The default provider is vmware, so don't have to specify
provider.

cd ~/tmp/vgtest

Tonight I had a surprise. Vagrant reported a failure. It was trying to copy a
machine into a non-existent directory ~/.vagrant. That is where I keep the
VMWare Vagrant license. That was surprising. Support has see this before when
Vagrant Manager is running. I closed it and tried again and it worked fine. The
value of Vagrant Manager is that it makes visible machines that you have
running. Support explained that Vagrant Manager might be doing it. It was. He
opened a ticket. I added to [[https://github.com/lanayotech/vagrant-manager/issues/78][it]].

This is in BrewCask, but the download is waste of time. I have it locally.

I keep going back and forth on this one. Is it worth saving 15 minutes having to
install it myself?

Start it. It asks for your name. It asks about updates and stuff. Get them all.
Start Outlook. Enter in new license for that.

When activation occurs, the app always locks up then I quit it and it restarts
after sending an error report.

Don't let it access Contacts.

When it checks for updates, tell it to check daily.

This is 2.4 GiB. That is not much. If you get the US mirror it is 20 minutes.

That is if you are lucky.

That makes the automated installer very slow. I just don't like it.

I will deal with it by installing it manually [[https://tug.org/mactex/mirrorpage.html][here]].

At this point, definitely I can build my resume here.

Once that is installed, install gnuplot:

Doing provisioning using Kitchenplan and Brew and BrewCask still takes at least
6 hours. You still need to perform manual steps. For me, it is unavoidable. This
is painful. This is a waste of 6 hours. It is the waste of your evening. It is a
waste of your weekend.

My new plan is to get the box provisioned and image it there. I want to minimize
provisioning ever again. The opportunity here is that you learn new things each
time. That is cool. The problem is that your goal is not to learn new things
every time. It is a decision, and it needs to be thoughtfully made. This
evidence is valuable. It has helped me understand my decision to work in
virtuals here forward.

To image a full system:

- Note the base configuration, =01=
- Get system and application updates
- Trim contents of included-folders
  - Most of my stuff will never be in them anyway
  - More like DropBox and Git
    - Keep Git checkouts. Simpler. Update will get new stuff.
  - =/Users/gcr/Documents=
  - Empty the trash
  - Vagrant box definitions will exist under source control, but the individual
    boxes will only ever live in the storage locations configured for the
    provider
  - Double-check that all of your Git working-copies are pushed home.
- Disk utility
  - Verify disk permissions
    - Logs a lot of info
    - Unsure if any of it is useful
  - Repair disk permissions if necessary
    - At the very bottom will log "Permissions repair complete"
  - Verify disk
  - Repair disk if necessary
- For the clone exclude
  - =/Users/gcr/Downloads=
  - =/Users/gcr/Dropbox=
  - =/Users/gcr/tmp=
  - =/Users/gcr/.vagrant.d/boxes=
    - [[http://docs-v1.vagrantup.com/v1/docs/boxes.html][Reference]]
    - How this works is that when CCC cloned that disk image back to the machine,
      this directory was present, and it was empty. I was curious about whether
      the directory would be present or not and happy to see it was.
    - After upping a box successfully, I verified that the base box was
      installed here as expected
  - =/VirtualBox VMs=
    - VirtualBox stores its VMS here by default
    - When you start making changes to a Vagrant box, they are saved [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8225820/where-is-vagrant-saving-changes-to-the-vm][here]]
    - For example I booted up the Vagrant box from "Getting started", created a
      hello world file, logged out and halted it, and this directory was
      =tmp_default_1426807980079_94539= was created in there and it contained all
      of the .vbox stuff for that machine.
      - Verified that =vagrant destroy= deletes that directory
  - =/Users/gcr/Documents/Virtual Machines=
    - http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/search.do?cmd=displayKC&docType=kc&docTypeID=DT_KB_1_1&externalId=2056798
    - This seems to be the directory where VMWare creates machines when you do
      so through the GUI
  - When Vagrant VMWare Fusion creates machines it creates them inside of a
    =.vagrant= directory where the Vagrantfile lives.
      - The path is =<directory where the Vagrant file lives>/.vagrant/machines/default/vmware_fusion=
      - Found this info [[https://blog.safaribooksonline.com/2014/01/16/building-vagrant-vms-with-the-vmware-fusion-provider/][here]] and verified it on my machine
      - Verified that =vagrant destroy= deletes that directory
- Make sure that this configuration, including Kitchenplan, is tagged
- Note that tag here:
  - Machine name
  - Built from image
  - Provisioning Tag
  - Timestamp
  - c02M-01-v1.7-2015-03-17T18:58:40-0500
- On successful creation of the new image
  - Erase the machine and clone the new image to it
    - Address any image restoration issues now
  - Backup this new image to Stargate
  - Copy the Dropbox folder
