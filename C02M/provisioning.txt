1 Reminders
═══════════

  • The means justify the ends
    • Makes entirety of the effort achievable, sensible, and valuable
  • Be ready for surprises
    • You will learn new things every run
    • You will be surprised by things every run
    • You have to decide if it is an opportunity to better things or it
      is something to get upset about
      • Only you may decide
  • Each top level section might be completed in entirety
    • Take brakes between them
    • Take over-night breaks
    • The whole thing takes a while
  • Right-click to paste text into the terminal
    • If you Pretzel-v it, it doesn’t work right
  • Make scripts executable and run them
    • `sh' doesn’t do what you want and you always forget that
  • If one of your purchased apps doesn’t show up in AppStore then just
    buy it again
    • The store will detect that you already own it and ask you to
      install it
    • Growl always has this problem
    • Used to reboot to fix it, but unreliable
  • This whole thing only makes sense when you read each line
    • Partially because you forget after not doing it for a while
    • The order is critical
    • A lot of the steps are automated and only make sense after you
      understand the entire script
    • There are still a lot of manual steps though
    • For example automate app installs and manually configure them,
      *before* moving on to the next section
    • Everything must be completed before moving on to the next thing
  • Disk image verification
    • Recipes exist to disable it
    • I don't use them; I want to know every time that all of my disk
      images are in a known good state
  • Try running every program
    • Only way to identify failures
    • Only way to automate the correct way
    • Continue to find new issues and fixes
  • Total transparency
    • I've run this 7 times already
    • Every time I run it I find new bugs and new improvements
    • Provisioning reveals just how much
      • One doesn't know about their OS
      • Things can go really well despite the fact we don't know how to
        do it right
  • Automated provisioning is handled by [kitchenplan]
  • Be thoughtful
    • This is not unique to this box, I just always forget
    • For example when I install emacs
      • I didn't think about using the main GNU release versus
        railwaycat's
        • That was dumb because I didn't think about the implications
      • First time, I installed all additioonal libraries
        • That was dumb because you should only install what you
          specifically need
      • Brew
        • It is very easy to use Brew
        • It will install a lot of stuff to make you happy
        • If you don't pay attention to what it does to make you happy
          then it will eventually make you unhappy
  • Only run this setup with a reliable high-speed Internet connection
    • Ran this at off-site, and 40% of the downloads failed
  • Once you get comfortable a couple of things happen
    • You try to paralellize stuff to save time and it is a big mistake
      which totally defeats the purpose of taking it slowly and easy
      because inevitably you will make mistakes
    • You forget that the means justify the ends; take it slowly and
      easy and perform the steps in that manner
    • You will form an opinion based upon experience rather than fantasy
      • Everyone is entitled to an opinion
      • Some opinions are more valuabe then others
      • Experience trumps fantasy *every* time
      • Take this dev-ops task as an opportunity to form your own
        person-preference
      • Valuable opinions come about as a result of a lot of good
        learning

2 Prerequisites, Manual
═══════════════════════

2.1 Scripts
───────────

  • Log into BitBucket/GitHub using Safari
    • When I develop this system, do so out of GitHub and when I
      finished I publish it via GitHub.
  • Download the hardware repo to get a current copy all the artifacts
  • Keep the setup guide open both on a smartphone and on the computer
    to clearly track what is happening where
    • Seems like overkill but it is really simpler because it is easy to
      lose your place during reboots when OSX "forgets" the line that
      you were on
  • Previously I copied the contents to a hard drive and this was
    useless because in order to provision a machine you require Internet
    access so nothing was made easier with this step


2.2 Image Disk
──────────────

  • Boot from EF4829
  • Dismount C02M
  • Erase C02M
    • You have the ability to specify the file system (FS) here
    • For this guide, it is not required, because CCC will restore a
      disk image that has a file system that is Mac OS Extended
      Journaled (MOSEJ)
    • The default is Mac OS Extended (not journaled)
    • I suspect though that if I don't specify it here, then at some
      point I will either copy or move this passage of text, and since
      it does not mention the desired file system (MOSEJ), that it will
      result in a documentation bug
    • When you do this, specify the FS and MOSEJ
  • Mount 01
  • Restore 01 to C02M
  • Dismount 01
  • Restore rescue partition on C02M
  • Boot from C02M
  • Dismount EF4829


2.3 Recovery Partition
──────────────────────

  • Pretzel-r on boot to enter it
  • This makes sure that it works


2.3.1 Console Password (One Time Only)
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  • Set the firmware password


2.4 System Preferences
──────────────────────

2.4.1 Keyboard
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  • Swapped caps lock and control


2.4.2 Displays
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  • Resolution: Scaled
    • More Space (1920x1200

  • Arrangement
    • Mirror screens


2.5 Software Updates
────────────────────

  • Installed software updates
    • Previously this was followed by manual reboot and that was
      needless
  • On restart, check updates again by clicking on it to see if there
    are more and if there are then install them
    • There is a slight delay where the screen says that there are no
      updates /before/ it refreshes and tellls you that it is again
      checking


2.6 Profile
───────────

  Download the `~/.profile' and evaluate it. This may be a download, or
  just copy from the download of the repo. I am working through the best
  option, as both have seemed fine.

  ┌────
  │ export PS1='\u@\h:\w> '
  │ export HOMEBREW_NO_EMOJI=1
  │ export INFOPATH='/usr/local/share/info:/usr/share/info'
  │ export VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=vmware_fusion
  │ source `brew --repository`/Library/Contributions/brew_bash_completion.sh
  │ export EELIB="/Users/$(whoami)/EELIB"
  │ export JAVA_HOME="/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_40.jdk/Contents/Home"
  │ export MACTEX_BIN="/usr/local/texlive/2014/bin/x86_64-darwin"
  │ export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$JAVA_HOME/bin:$MACTEX_BIN:$PATH
  │ alias r='r --no-save'
  │ alias R='r --no-save'
  │ alias bbc='~/git/github-grettke/stathon/stathon.py ~/git/bitbucket-grettke/ | grep True'
  │ alias gbc='~/git/github-grettke/stathon/stathon.py ~/git/github-grettke/ | grep True'
  └────

  After setting up the system, just link it here:

  ┌────
  │ cd ~/
  │ rm .profile
  │ ln -s ~/git/bitbucket-grettke/hardware/apple/macbookpro/c02m/.profile .profile
  └────


2.7 Install XCode
─────────────────

  I want Xcode. I want the CLT. I want the IDE and more. I also want
  KitchenPlan. The installation order of these things was not obvious to
  me. I got it wrong 3 times. Now it works correctly. Install Xcode and
  then CLT and then everyone seems to be happy.

  Go to the App Store and install it.

  You must start Xcode and agree to its licensing. Afterwards, close it.

  For reference, see where it lives.

  ┌────
  │ xcode-select --print-path
  └────

  ┌────
  │ /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
  └────

  Now install the CLT. Choose *Install*.

  ┌────
  │ xcode-select --install
  └────

  Note here that the Xcode path does not change. I don't understand
  this. What I think is happening is that Xcode is installed and that it
  is providing everything that is required and CLT piggy-backs on it.

  ┌────
  │ xcode-select --print-path
  └────

  ┌────
  │ /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
  └────


2.8 Brew and BrewCask
─────────────────────

  Brew is [here].

  Run

  ┌────
  │ brew doctor
  └────

  BrewCask is [here].


  [here] http://brew.sh

  [here] http://caskroom.io


3 Git, Semi-Automated
═════════════════════

  After setting up this box, check out your stuff later before imaging.


3.1 Manual
──────────

  Install DiffMerge.

  Previously I used Meld. That worked fine. It was in Python. Brew
  installed it's own Python. I didn't like that. That is why I switched
  to DiffMerge. I didn't want to install Brew Python in addition to OSX
  Python. Personal preference.

  My old setup had a problem. In Git I set up the external.diff to Meld.
  external.diff is only for command line tools. Meld is a GUI. That was
  wrong. I got a poor-user experience with git and vc-diff and Magit as
  a result.

  This is the first BrewCask install, so it asks you for your password.

  ┌────
  │ brew cask install diffmerge
  └────

  Later in this setup, once the fonts are installed, set this font to
  DJSM 14. That is smaller than the Emacs default on my system. That is
  OK because I want to do side-by-side diffs in 50% of the screen. 14 is
  a fine balance between readability and fitting in that space.


3.2 Automated
─────────────

  Generate the key. There is no passphrase.
  ┌────
  │ mkdir ~/.ssh
  │ cd ~/.ssh
  │ ssh-keygen -N '' -t rsa -C "gcr@wisdomandwonder.com" -f orion_gcr_rsa
  └────

  Set permissions so that `ssh' will run.

  ┌────
  │ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/orion_gcr_rsa
  │ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/orion_gcr_rsa.pub
  │ ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/orion_gcr_rsa
  └────

  OSX creates this directory everywhere and it must be ignored.
  ┌────
  │ echo .DS_Store >> ~/.gitignore_global
  │ git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
  └────

  Add they key to Bitbucket and Github.
  ┌────
  │ cat ~/.ssh/orion_gcr_rsa.pub | pbcopy
  │ read -p "The new key is in your clipboard. Go and add this key to BitBucket and GitHub. When you are finished, hit [enter] to continue."
  └────

  │ EOF
  └────

  Test each one out.
  ┌────
  │ ssh -T github-grettke
  │ read -p "Did it work? If not, fix it."
  └────

  Separate them to allow for easier copy-pasting.

  ┌────
  │ ssh -T bitbucket-grettke
  │ read -p "Did it work? If not, fix it."
  └────

  Set up my preferences.
  ┌────
  │ git config --global user.name "Grant Rettke"
  │ git config --global user.email gcr@wisdomandwonder.com
  │ git config --global core.editor vi
  │ git config --global color.ui true

  │ git config --global mergetool.keepBackup false
  │ git config --global diff.tool diffmerge
  │ git config --global difftool.diffmerge.cmd "/usr/local/bin/diffmerge \$LOCAL \$REMOTE"
  └────

  Check out projects to get basic stuff working.
  ┌────
  │ mkdir -p ~/git/bitbucket-grettke
  │ mkdir -p ~/git/github-grettke
  │ mkdir -p ~/git/github-anon
  │ cd ~/git/bitbucket-grettke

  └────

  There are a lot of ways to manage libraries for Python. There are also
  many ways to manage Python installations. I am not considering any of
  them here. My approach is to use the base-box as a base. It needs to
  do certain things well. These directions are for my current approach.

  Directions for installing Pip live [here].

  ┌────
  │ mkdir ~/tmp
  │ cd ~/tmp
  │ curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
  │ sudo -H python ./get-pip.py
  └────

  Install GitPython for Stathon.

  ┌────
  │ sudo pip install GitPython==0.3.2.RC1
  └────


  [here] https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html


4 OSX GUI Config, Manual
════════════════════════

  Read the [directions].

  ┌────
  │ sudo gem install kitchenplan
  └────

  Start the setup.

  ┌────
  │ kitchenplan setup
  └────

  When it asks, give my aliased URL so I can work right out of that
  directory.

  ┌────
  │ github-grettke:grettke/kitchenplan.git
  └────

  Provision it.

  ┌────
  │ kitchenplan provision
  └────

  Log in and out again to see changes. Previously I would reboot the
  machine, but that seems unnecessary.

  The first two times I tested this, the desktop picture was set
  correctly. The 3rd time it was not. Also 4-6. I'm leaving that alone
  for now.

  KitchenPlan may be run repeatedly. After completing various sections
  of this script I re-ran KitchenPlan. It worked correctly.

5 Emacs Environment Semi-Automated
══════════════════════════════════

  This is what it takes to get an Emacs+Org development environment set
  up. Nearly everything is included but for LaTeX, which has an enormous
  download.

  The way that I like to go through this is to:
  • Perform the steps in the manual section
  • Execute `emacs-run.sh' for the automated stuff
  • Perform the manual configuration for everything that got installed
    • Directions are in `emacs-read.org'


5.1 System Software
───────────────────

5.1.1 Manual
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

◊ 5.1.1.1 Fonts

  ┌────
  │ Manually install fonts used for Emacs.
  │
  │ Fonts that will be installed:
  │ - DejaVu
  │ - NotoSans
  │ - NotoSansSymbols
  │ - Quivira
  │ - Symbola
  │
  │ They live in the font dir in the ALEC project.
  │
  │ Steps to install them:
  │ - Extract them
  │ - Start Font Book
  │ - Create a new COLLECTION "Emacs"
  │ - Drag the top-level  directory into the collection
  │   - Font Book will search through it recursively for fonts and add them
  │ - Correct any resolution issues, which happen every time so far
  └────


◊ 5.1.1.2 Terminal

  Select the Solarized dark theme. It is checked out in Github-Anon. Go
  into preferences, choose it, and set it as the default.

  Set the font to DJSM 17.


◊ 5.1.1.3 Growl

  Install Growl via AppStore. Run it. Enable it to run on login.


5.1.2 Automated
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  Do the manual configuration of this stuff right away. The system is
  unusable without it. For some reason I find it easy to forget that.


◊ 5.1.2.1 XQuartz

  Why is this here? It used to be for Meld. Meld went away. It
  definitely /feels/ right to be here. It is nice to have a X-Server.
  Stuff like the `dot' tool use X. I am staying true-enough here.

  This install asks for a password. I am done researching what asks for
  a password and what does not. Perfect world I would do that and break
  out the steps into things that ask for a password and things that to
  do not. In that perfect world, time does not exist. To do this in a
  world with time will take a lot of it.

  Asking for passwords appears to be an application-specific event and
  not based on order of Brew and BrewCask installs. Even if there is
  more to it, I am not researching it more now.

  ┌────
  │ brew cask install xquartz
  └────


◊ 5.1.2.2 Karabiner

  ┌────
  │ brew cask install karabiner
  └────

  ┌────
  │ Run it. Approve it. Configure it with the following. Look for the
  │ heading with the name below following "Modify".
  │
  │ #+begin_src sh
  │ Modify "Change Return Key".
  │ Check:

  │ (+ When you type Return only, send Return)"
  │ #+end_src
  └────


◊ 5.1.2.3 Spectacle

  ┌────
  │ brew cask install spectacle
  └────

  ┌────
  │ Run it. Approve it. Set it to run at login.
  └────


◊ 5.1.2.4 Bartender

  ┌────
  │ brew cask install bartender
  └────

  ┌────
  │ - GENERAL
  │   - Launch Bartender at login: yes.
  │   - At bartender launch: show bartender bar: NO.
  │   - Bartender bar: autohides, YES.
  │ - Menu bar icon highlight
  │   - Show when bartender bar is open: YES.
  │   - Bartender menu baricon:
  │ - ADVANCED
  │   - Bartender menu bar icon: visible YES.
  │   - Clicking on bartender will: open bartender bar.
  │   - For everything moved into the gutter

◊ 5.1.2.5 Growlnotify

  ┌────
  │ brew cask install growlnotify
  └────


◊ 5.1.2.6 CCrypt

  ┌────
  │ brew install ccrypt
  └────


◊ 5.1.2.7 Aspell

  ┌────
  │ brew install aspell -all
  └────


◊ 5.1.2.8 Java

  At this point, test out Java and Langtool. The full Org stuff requires
  more configuration, like Ditaa. This assumes that you've done the
  Emacs final config stuff based on warnings at startup of Emacs; not on
  directions on this document.

  ┌────
  │ brew cask install java
  └────


5.2 Emacs
─────────

  I quit using railwaycat's emacs macport. It was really nice. One night
  I reprovisionined my machine. railwaycat's repo was down. I learned
  that it was a one-man show. I never thought about it. It means that it
  is not supported well. Things that are supported well are likely to be
  available. I switched to the GNU Emacs app. It has those desirable
  traits.

  ImageMagic is required for the Emacs install, so install it first.

  ┌────
  │ brew install imagemagick --with-fftw --with-fontconfig --with-webp --with-x11
  └────

  With all of Emacs prerequisites satisfied, install it now.

  ┌────
  │ brew install emacs --cocoa --with-gnutls --with-imagemagick
  │ brew linkapps
  └────

  The installer lists caveats. Do I need to know of these for each
  installer???

  Now link my .emacs.el and try tangling.

  ┌────
  │ ln -s ~/git/bitbucket-grettke/alec/.emacs.el ~/.emacs.el
  │ ln -s ~/git/bitbucket-grettke/alec/.aspell.en.pws ~/.aspell.en.pws
  │ ln -s ~/git/bitbucket-grettke/alec/.aspell.en.prepl ~/.aspell.en.prepl
  └────

  The eshell config lives under .emacs.d. It doesn't exist until Emacs
  is run. This setup creates a link to the real .emacs.d. Create the
  directory first and then link it.

  ┌────
  │ mkdir ~/.emacs.d
  │ ln -s ~/git/bitbucket-grettke/alec/eshell/ ~/.emacs.d/eshell
  └────

  Start Emacs. Remember any Emacs fixes. Everything should work.


6 Productivity Semi-Automated
═════════════════════════════

  To be immediately productive with the most common use cases, I need
  all of these apps.

  Use cases:

  • Communications
  • Productivity
  • Word processing
  • Productivity is pretty broadly defined here. It means everything.

  The installation process is similar to Emacs up above:

  • Install the software automatically
  • Configure it manually
  • Manually run it and make sure that it is happy
    • You will find new stuff everytime you do this and you will get
      better at dev-ops and automate as much of it as you can and want
      to do

  I am curious about how best to automate this portion of the
  installation. My approaches were in order:

  • Just let it run and try stuff later
    • Allows for installation failures which I don't like, it wastes
      time discovering the issue and resolving it
  • Verify that each app starts
    • This is a fine approach. I would like to know at installation time
      though if there is a failure. Reading the transcript would be a
      good approach. Perhaps I should capture it, too.
    • Works easily for command line stuff via a script. GUI stuff is
      slower when I run it through Spotlight. Perhaps it is worth
      tracking down the installation directories of everything and
      starting them up via `open'?
      • Is this level of reproducibility required? Might need to
        quantify this.

  Read through the installation messages at least once. You will learn
  things and then you will improve the installation process.


6.1 Files
─────────

  I always end up keeping these temp files. Yes, temp files. They don't
  live in source control.

  ┌────
  │ touch ~/tmp/post.org
  │ touch ~/tmp/scratch.org
  │ touch ~/tmp/todo.org

  This one is first so that I'll have easy access to licenses.

  ┌────
  │ brew cask install dropbox
  └────

  ┌────
  │ Sign in.
  │ In Login Items, start Dropbox.
  │ When on highspeed, just sync everything after copying locally of course.
  │ When on lowspeed, just sync required.

  ┌────
  │ brew cask install skype

  Got a surprise today. After doing 7 runs, Skype was installed but it
  was not sucessfully linked into /Application. That is surprising. It
  is installed under the BrewCask (cask room) location:

  ┌────
  │ /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/skype/latest/Skype
  └────

  The the link to Applications didn't exist so Skype was not added to
  Login Items. I manually added it. I clicked `+'. This Mac. Searched
  for "Skype". Then I chose it.

6.9 Racket
──────────

  Need this for resume stuff. At this point at least Racket is
  installed. Here I found that Pandoc was not set up right. After
  everything is done, including manually installing MacTeX, I could
  build my resume here.

6.18 Stuff That Asks For My Password
────────────────────────────────────

6.18.1 R
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  This is the first BrewCask install where I saw a checksum error:

  ┌────
  │ ==> Caveats

  │ files can cause warnings when running "brew doctor", which is considered

  │ To retry an incomplete download, remove the file above.
  └────

  The software was downloaded. Its checksum was wrong. Now what? This
  isn't the end of the world. I am glad it reported it. I am not
  investigating the mismatch. I suspect that there is a newer release
  and the formula wasn't updated. That is fine. I will delete that
  download and install it manually. This is a story I want to capture.
  Things aren't always perfect. There are so many moving parts that this
  is bound to happen. Patches are usually always welcomed, too.

  To handle this manual install, I read the OSX page for R. They explain
  that we ought to compare the checksum of the download and show how.
  The current hashes are:

  ┌────
  │ MD5-hash: 2f263bbb394361b5c3dd0d882d1d2e70
  │ SHA1-hash: 200349fbcfd14b8b4769b52340164dd728c3995c
  │ (ca. 68MB)
  └────

  You may see the download size in MiB via:

  ┌────
  │ cd ~/Downloads
  │ du -h R-3.1.3-mavericks.pkg
  └────

  ┌────
  │  68M    R-3.1.3-mavericks.pkg
  └────

  You may check the checksum via:

  ┌────
  │ cd ~/Downloads
  │ md5 R-3.1.3-mavericks.pkg
  └────

  ┌────
  │ MD5 (R-3.1.3-mavericks.pkg) = 2f263bbb394361b5c3dd0d882d1d2e70
  └────

  Install the software.

  ┌────
  │ brew cask install r
  │ ln -s ~/git/bitbucket-grettke/alec/.Renviron ~/.Renviron
  │ ln -s ~/git/bitbucket-grettke/alec/.Rprofile ~/.Rprofile
  │ ln -s ~/git/bitbucket-grettke/alec/.Rinstall ~/.Rinstall
  │ rm -rf ~/.Rpackages
  │ mkdir ~/.Rpackages
  └────

  Explain what to do with it.

  ┌────
  │ I haven't used R in a long time but I want to get it set up right again.
  │ Link my configs from ~/ into where they live now.
  │ This installer asks for my password, which halts the install. How will I deal

◊ 6.18.2.1 Vagrant Manager

  ┌────
  │ brew cask install vagrant-manager
  └────

  Tonight I had a surprise. Vagrant reported a failure. It was trying to
  copy a machine into a non-existent directory ~/.vagrant. That is where
  I keep the VMWare Vagrant license. That was surprising. Support has
  see this before when Vagrant Manager is running. I closed it and tried
  again and it worked fine. The value of Vagrant Manager is that it
  makes visible machines that you have running. Support explained that
  Vagrant Manager might be doing it. It was. He opened a ticket. I added
  to [it].

7 Productivity, Manual
══════════════════════

7.1 By Hand
───────────

7.1.1 Entropy
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  This is a [download] and manual install.


  [download] http://www.eigenlogik.com/entropy/


7.1.2 Guitar Pro
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  [Here]. Sign into MySongBook.

7.1.3 Cepestral Callie & David
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  [Here].

  You might need to log out and in again to make the "Cepstral Voices"
  appear in System Preferences.

  License them. Test them.

  Set Dictation & Text to Speech to: Callie


  [Here] http://www.cepstral.com/


7.1.4 Microsoft Office
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  This is in BrewCask, but the download is waste of time. I have it
  locally.

  I keep going back and forth on this one. Is it worth saving 15 minutes
  having to install it myself?

  Start it. It asks for your name. It asks about updates and stuff. Get
  them all. Start Outlook. Enter in new license for that.

  When activation occurs, the app always locks up then I quit it and it
  restarts after sending an error report.

  Don't let it access Contacts.

  When it checks for updates, tell it to check daily.


7.1.5 MacTex & GnuPlot
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  This is 2.4 GiB. That is not much. If you get the US mirror it is 20
  minutes.

  That is if you are lucky.

  That makes the automated installer very slow. I just don't like it.

  I will deal with it by installing it manually [here].

  At this point, definitely I can build my resume here.

  Once that is installed, install gnuplot:

  ┌────
  │ brew install gnuplot --with-latex --with-pdflib-lite --with-tests --with-x11
  └────

  Build my resume at this point, too.

9 Full System Backups
═════════════════════

  Doing provisioning using Kitchenplan and Brew and BrewCask still takes
  at least 6 hours. You still need to perform manual steps. For me, it
  is unavoidable. This is painful. This is a waste of 6 hours. It is the
  waste of your evening. It is a waste of your weekend.

  My new plan is to get the box provisioned and image it there. I want
  to minimize provisioning ever again. The opportunity here is that you
  learn new things each time. That is cool. The problem is that your
  goal is not to learn new things every time. It is a decision, and it
  needs to be thoughtfully made. This evidence is valuable. It has
  helped me understand my decision to work in virtuals here forward.

  To image a full system:

  • Note the base configuration, `01'
  • Get system and application updates
  • Trim contents of included-folders
    • Most of my stuff will never be in them anyway
    • More like DropBox and Git
      • Keep Git checkouts. Simpler. Update will get new stuff.
    • `/Users/gcr/Documents'
    • Empty the trash
    • Vagrant box definitions will exist under source control, but the
      individual boxes will only ever live in the storage locations
      configured for the provider
    • Run `bc' and `gc'
  • Disk utility
    • Verify disk permissions
      • Logs a lot of info
      • Unsure if any of it is useful
    • Repair disk permissions if necessary
      • At the very bottom will log "Permissions repair complete"
    • Verify disk
    • Repair disk if necessary
  • For the clone exclude
    • `/Users/gcr/Downloads'
    • `/Users/gcr/Dropbox'
    • `/Users/gcr/tmp'
    • `/Users/gcr/.vagrant.d/boxes'
      • [http://docs-v1.vagrantup.com/v1/docs/boxes.html]
      • How this works is that when CCC cloned that disk image back to
        the machine, this directory was present, and it was empty. I was
        curious about whether the directory would be present or not and
        happy to see it was.
      • After upping a box successfully, I verified that the base box
        was installed here as expected
    • `/VirtualBox VMs'
      • VirtualBox stores its VMS here by default
      • When you start making changes to a Vagrant box, they are saved
        [here]
      • For example I booted up the Vagrant box from "Getting started",
        created a hello world file, logged out and halted it, and this
        directory was `tmp_default_1426807980079_94539' was created in
        there and it contained all of the .vbox stuff for that machine.
        • Verified that `vagrant destroy' deletes that directory
    • `/Users/gcr/Documents/Virtual Machines'
      • [http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/search.do?cmd=displayKC&docType=kc&docTypeID=DT_KB_1_1&externalId=2056798]
      • This seems to be the directory where VMWare creates machines
        when you do so through the GUI
    • When Vagrant VMWare Fusion creates machines it creates them inside
      of a `.vagrant' directory where the Vagrantfile lives.
      • The path is `<directory where the Vagrant file
        lives>/.vagrant/machines/default/vmware_fusion'
      • Found this info [here] and verified it on my machine
      • Verified that `vagrant destroy' deletes that directory
  • Make sure that this configuration, including Kitchenplan, is tagged
  • Note that tag here:
    • Machine name
    • Built from image
    • Provisioning Tag
    • Timestamp
    • c02M-01-v1.7-2015-03-17T18:58:40-0500
  • On successful creation of the new image
    • Erase the machine and clone the new image to it
      • Address any image restoration issues now
    • Backup this new image to Stargate
    • Copy the Dropbox folder
