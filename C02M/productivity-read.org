# [[file:provisioning.org::*Little%20Snitch][B694BF8F-7EA0-4CFA-82F7-E71E0D00D281]]
As of writing, the installer just gets downloaded and you need to run it like
this:

#+begin_src sh
open /opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/little-snitch/3.5.1/Little Snitch Installer.app/
#+end_src

Typical usage is to grant every program full access for any connection, forever,
until there is a reason not to do so.

Sign into Chrome. Let the settings sync. All the JS disabling stuff needs
you to approve it. It is irritating. You always forget to approve it and make
it worse. Disable ScriptSafe right away. Turn it on as needed.

I haven't used R in a long time but I want to get it set up right again.
Link my configs from ~/ into where they live now.
This installer asks for my password, which halts the install. How will I deal
with this?
There is a =.Rinstall= file in my setup to get all of the packages installed. Be s
sure to run that, too. All of my notes live in R.org already.

# [[file:provisioning.org::*Vagrant][51C62035-888C-4AB9-928B-F6B6AD8BDC83]]
Install the VMWare provider for Vagrant and then license it.

Remember to [[http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/other/debugging.html][log]] appropriately.

It goes something like this:

#+begin_src sh
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vmware-fusion
mkdir ~/.vagrant
cd ~/.vagrant
# copy that license file in there
vagrant plugin license vagrant-vmware-fusion license.lic
cd
rm -rf ~/.vagrant
#+end_src

Verify the plugin is licensed and happy:

#+NAME: CCCFA8CD-1754-4BD6-A355-7907E885B6C4
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
vagrant plugin list
#+END_SRC

Test out VirtualBox box:

#+begin_src sh
cd ~/tmp
mkdir vgtest
cd vgtest
vagrant init hashicorp/precise64
vagrant up --provider virtualbox
#+end_src

The first time I tried this, it failed. I restarted OSX. Then it worked.

Test out VMWare. The default provider is vmware, so don't have to specify
provider.

#+begin_src sh
cd ~/tmp/vgtest
vagrant up
#+end_src
