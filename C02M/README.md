# Literate DevOps: OS X Development System

Setting up a development system is a non-trivial investment.

This document captures the steps required and automates as much as possible.

The Style Guide is a **must read** for the operator.

[Org-Mode](http://orgmode.org/) converted this manual, tedious, and error prone task to a
semi-automated, nearly reproducible, and error-less process, for *me*. This document
has never been beta tested; I am it&rsquo;s **only** user.
