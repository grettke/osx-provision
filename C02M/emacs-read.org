Manually install fonts used for Emacs.

Fonts that will be installed:

- Symbola

They live in the font dir in the ALEC project.

Steps to install them:
- Extract them
- Start Font Book
- Create a new COLLECTION "Emacs"
- Drag the top-level  directory into the collection
  - Font Book will search through it recursively for fonts and add them
- Correct any resolution issues, which happen every time so far
