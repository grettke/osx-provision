* R

I haven't used R in a long time but I want to get it set up right again.
Link my configs from ~/ into where they live now.
This installer asks for my password, which halts the install. How will I deal
with this?
There is a =.Rinstall= file in my setup to get all of the packages installed. Be s
sure to run that, too. All of my notes live in R.org already.

Install the software manually.

Migrate and link the configuration files
