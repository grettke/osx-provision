* STOP!

These are *all* of my /personal notes/ on provisioning my boxes. They won't make
sense unless you read all of them. They are long… you won't want to :). You
/are/ welcome to read them.

If you are here then you probably only want to see the setup steps. They are a
subset of this document. They live in =provisioning.md= and get tangled to
individual files for implementation.

:END:

- Verify easily verifiable operations
  - Installation scripts often reveal new information
- Either name things with a meaningful name or a 6 digit UUID from
  [[https://www.uuidgenerator.net/][Online UUID Generator]]
  - In the beginning this helped me keep track of disks, VMs, and software;
    by working through it I found that names were more meaningful, only after
    developing the sections for the definition (and name)
- Evidence based; no fantasy or delusion
  - Decide using experience; in absence make a best decision and move on
  - It takes at least 3 iterations before things start making sense
- "Thinking ahead" is crippling
- Snapshot
  - After expensive operations
    - Can always delete them later
    - Easy to for get how to do
  - Snapshot frequently; you never know how things will go
    - You will forget to do this
    - You will only care after something got wrecked
- Don't go to sleep in the middle of configuration sections
- Get the fastest Internet sold before starting
- Remember that Control-Command-F pressed inside of a host tells VMWare
  to go to and from full-screen.
- VMWare's folder sharing
  - Works perfectly for sharing between two guests a lot of the time. When it
    quits working I log in and out of one of the guests and it works again
    - Happens often
  - Is happy with Finder and unhappy with Eshell, so don't use Eshell in shared
    directories. They just stop working.
- Java
  - Sometimes the installation directory includes the build number. Sometimes
    it does not.
- Writing 100% automated idempotent scripts is worth the effort
  - It is not worth the effort for theoretical reasons because it is usually
    faster to do it by hand. The first 2 or 3 times you perform a task, it is
    slow, and then you figure it how to do it all correctly and then you can
    perform it quickly. You might ask yourself "If I can do it this quickly then
    why bother automated it?" because of the extra effort. That is a good
    question. When you are doing it, it is faster to do it by hand. Here is the
    problem that I ran into: you make mistakes that you find long after the
    set up. The /right/ thing to do is to correct the documentation/scripts and
    then rebuild the image. If you left manual steps then you have to do that
    work all over again. I know this seems obvious, but at the time, it didn't
    seem worth the effort of automating everything. Now much later, I'm left
    with a system imaged somewhat differently than the documentation. It is
    worth the effort to automate everything. The item on snap-shotting makes this
    easier.
  - After using them only 2 times you will feel how flexible and fun it makes
    the whole development process
- Never allow manual steps
  - If they are unavoidable then move them all to the same place to get them
    over with and start the automated part
- Make VMWare Disk Drive capacity in multiples of 8
  - That way they can be easily shared and transferred on SD cards
- VMWare Fusion hard disk size
  - VMWare does not pre-allocate disk space and doesn't give you the option
    to do so. This is different than VMWare Workstation and that might surprise
    you.
- Spending most of my time on OSX
  - Started out planning on using 100% OSX. That led me to realize that I
    value OSS/Emacs the most. So I started to set up Linux. Through that effort
    I realized how much I've invested on the OSX platform. I felt that not only
    would it take too much additional effort to migrated to Linux; but more-so
    that the investment would take away from future work I would be doing on
    OSX. Both thing are surprising.
- A new to me option is to download everything and don't configure it until you
  need it
  - Pros
    - Faster setup
    - Only use what you need
    - Nothing stopping you from configuring anything; key is to know what you
      want immediately available when you restore a snapshot or image, assuming
      that it is not automatically configurable or you don't want to
      automatically configure it (which is rare)
- Deleting the RP
  - DU does not list the RP. CCC does. You work a lot with DU and a little with
    CCC. When you modify the disk partitions, you have to rebuild the RP with
    CCC. It is easy to forget to do this. I am not sure now how to restore the
    RP without a working RP.
- Utilize compressed disk images
  - Save space
  - On the SSD they are fast
- How to utilize hosts and guests
  - I had the idea that I would work 100% in the guest because that is simple
    and familiar. It didn't work out well because audio in Skype was horrible.
    So I installed Skype in the host and use it there. Now I use both host and
    guest.
    - Is it a waste of space to use the same provisioner for both host and
      guest? No. It is important to have one script that does the right thing
      instead of having to worry about two boxes. It also fails the goal of
      having a single transportable and re-usable guest that can easily and
      completely move between hosts.
- Always use the present tense for directions and the past tense for notes
- Software downloads during provisioning often fail
- =brew= is explicit
  - You need to pay attention to the command at least once. Some applications
    will auto-install them self when you try to run them, and that is great.
    Others don't and run from the Caskroom. Sometimes the latter is fine, other
    times it is not.
- Working on identically provisioned boxes where one will replace the other
  - Easy to confuse them and muck things up on the "good one"
  - Easy to test valuable changes in the "new one" and blow them away before
    pushing them to a remote git repo or migrating them back into the "good one"
    to do so
  - Forget about what you did where, and blow it away while reverting snapshots
- Ignore the urge to provision on-the-metal until you've provisioned a box 5-10
  times and have used it for a month or two without major changes
  - Every other time will be to soon
- Backups
  - Keep everything you value
    - On another computer
      - Local or remote
  - Minimize stress during non-trivial provisioning efforts
- Download speed is the weakest link
  - Separate work into separate steps to get downloads finished and configure
    later
- Every single provisioning run is different because
  - You learn new things: want to fix stuff, want to make it better
  - Things change: new versions, stuff not available
  - Everything you script ends up being designed around being able to make
    mistakes
    - Easily resize partitions
    - Easily reprovision (idempotent)
    - Easily recover from unknowns and errors and learning

Get a 7200RPM 1TB external disk drive with USB3 or Lightning.

Create a partition named =Storage= that is at least 100GB. The =EXT:= naming
convention is to indicate that it lives on an external device. This is helpful
to make sense of partitions there versus on the Macintosh HD. That is not part
of the name of the partition itself. I'll use that naming also to indicate
computers that contain a single disk drive.

Keep a working Mac nearby. You will use it to work with the contents of
your Git repositories, research configuration steps, and rest easy knowing that
you've always got a working machine.

Make sure that it has Internet access and download all of your Git repositories
required for configuring these machines.

Don't try use your host computer for this role by booting it to an external
drive; it is too easy to confuse partitions and what you are doing.

Use CCC to clone this Mac's partition, =Support:Macintosh HD=, to a partition on
=EXT=. The easiest thing to do is to connect =EXT=
to =Support Computer=. Create a new partition big enough to hold it and perform
the clone. Name it =EXT:Utility=. Reboot to it to test it.

- Collect the Pristine Host Operating System Image (PHOSI)
  - Pristine means that it has never been logged into or configured
  - Has the latest OS X on it with at least the second fix pack or later
  - Verify that it contains the RP for that OS X on the disk
    - If the imaging takes less than 10 minutes then they didn't include the
      RP
  - You can easily get this from an appointment at the Genius Bar
- Create the Pristine Host Operating System Disk Image (PHOSDI)
  - Take your Mac home
  - Boot from =EXT:Utility=
  - Use CCC
    - From the host computer's =PHOSI=, =Host:Macintosh HD=
    - To

  - Boot into =Host:Macintosh HD=, configure it
  - Boot into =EXT:Support= and re-image =Host:Macintosh HD= from =PHOSDI=
  - Boot into =Host:Macintosh HD=
    - It should appear pristine, you need to enter all of the installation
      information again. This will be re-imaged again soon so don't worry
      about this.
  - Copy =EXT:Storage PHOSDI= to =Host:Storage=
- Create the =Host:Utility= partition using =PHOSDI=
  - Boot into =EXT:Support=
  - Create 1 new partition on =Host=, named =Utility=: 16GB

- Create a new machine by dragging the OS X Installer onto the dialog
- Continue
- Default configuration don't change anything
  - 40GB HD, 2 CPU, 2GB RAM seems fine and allows you to have another VM
    running for notes during configuration
  - Assuming that 40GB will be enough to allow OS updates as they occur over
    the lifetime of the operating system
  - Full-Clones will configure the machine in unique ways not worth capturing
    here
- Click Finish
  - Name it "El Capitan - Base (09d89d)" and leave all of the default machine configuration
    alone
- Installation takes 20m every time
  - Installer reports "35s remaining" accurately, and then 0s remaining
    inaccurately, and sits there for about 5 minutes
  - Then it reports 20m remaining, and completes in 15m
  any personal information or configuration
- Set up box and create =sysop=, don't configure, don't provision:
  - Use the name =sysop= and password =sysop=
  - Don't do it like you set up the host
  - Don't provision or customize anything
  - Don't set up printers or resolution
  - Just create the account and do nothing more

    it will fail for a couple of reasons like "The partition is not journaled"
    or "The operation filed". Instead, boot into the OS and resize the partition
    there.

    - Downloading mactex via direct-download is too slow
  - Out of the 10 tries to finish mactex and fix bugs, I wanted to manually fix
    things and move on. I didn't, and that is probably good. In the end, the
    automatic provisioner did it's job and I didn't do anything manually. That
    is a hard habit to break.
  - There is a different issue on every run. Sometimes the org-mode git checkout
    never completes. It sits at 98% forever. Control-Z and re-ran
- Named box "osiris"
- That is it; didn't even click around or inspect anything.
- Kept forgetting to copy the new version of the script onto the box; should
  automate that
- Shutdown
- Take a snapshot (while box is off)

This script should be idempotent.
Set the computer's "names". There are 3 resources ([[http://ilostmynotes.blogspot.com/2012/03/computername-vs-localhostname-vs.html][1]], [[http://osxdaily.com/2012/10/24/set-the-hostname-computer-name-and-bonjour-name-separately-in-os-x/][2]], [[http://hack.org/mc/writings/mac-survival.html][3]]) that I used to make
sense of the different names. It is simple, and new to me.

Originally I set every name to the same value. Doing so didn't result in
warnings but it did result in an incorrect "Computer Name" and
"Local Host Name". Based on that experience, I'm going to give names using this
strategy to name machines now:

- HostName
  - All lower case
  - <Logical name>-<UUID>.<org|vm>
- LocalHostName
  - All lower case
  - <Logical name>-<UUID>
- NetBIOS
  - All lower case
  - <Logical name>-<UUID>
- ComputerName
  - "<Logical name> (<UUID>)"

Defining this naming approach helped me learn more about the intent of the
name and what I wanted from them.

Install the VMWare provider for Vagrant and then license it.

Remember to [[http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/other/debugging.html][log]] appropriately.

It goes something like this:

,#+begin_src sh
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vmware-fusion
mkdir ~/.vagrant
cd ~/.vagrant
# copy that license file in there
vagrant plugin license vagrant-vmware-fusion license.lic
cd
rm -rf ~/.vagrant

Verify the plugin is licensed and happy:

Test out VirtualBox box:

,#+begin_src sh
cd ~/tmp
mkdir vgtest
cd vgtest
vagrant init hashicorp/precise64
vagrant up --provider virtualbox
,#+end_src

The first time I tried this, it failed. I restarted OSX. Then it worked.

Test out VMWare. The default provider is vmware, so don't have to specify
provider.

I haven't used R in a long time but I want to get it set up right again.
Link my configs from ~/ into where they live now.
This installer asks for my password, which halts the install. How will I deal
with this?
There is a =.Rinstall= file in my setup to get all of the packages installed. Be s
sure to run that, too. All of my notes live in R.org already.

Install the software manually.

This is in BrewCask, but the download is waste of time. I have it locally. Use
the version I bought; not the latest which is in brew.

I keep going back and forth on this one. Is it worth saving 15 minutes having to
install it myself?

Start it. It asks for your name. It asks about updates and stuff. Get them all.
Start Outlook. Enter in new license for that.

When activation occurs, the app always locks up then I quit it and it restarts
after sending an error report.

Don't let it access Contacts.

When it checks for updates, tell it to check daily.

Doing provisioning using Kitchenplan and Brew and BrewCask still takes at least
6 hours. You still need to perform manual steps. For me, it is unavoidable. This
is painful. This is a waste of 6 hours. It is the waste of your evening. It is a
waste of your weekend.

My new plan is to get the box provisioned and image it there. I want to minimize
provisioning ever again. The opportunity here is that you learn new things each
time. That is cool. The problem is that your goal is not to learn new things
every time. It is a decision, and it needs to be thoughtfully made. This
evidence is valuable. It has helped me understand my decision to work in
virtuals here forward.

To image a full system:

- Note the base configuration, =01=
- Get system and application updates
- Trim contents of included-folders
  - Most of my stuff will never be in them anyway
  - More like DropBox and Git
    - Keep Git checkouts. Simpler. Update will get new stuff.
  - =/Users/gcr/Documents=
  - Empty the trash
  - Vagrant box definitions will exist under source control, but the individual
    boxes will only ever live in the storage locations configured for the
    provider
  - Double-check that all of your Git working-copies are pushed home.
- Disk utility
  - Verify disk permissions
    - Logs a lot of info
    - Unsure if any of it is useful
  - Repair disk permissions if necessary
    - At the very bottom will log "Permissions repair complete"
  - Verify disk
  - Repair disk if necessary
- For the clone exclude
  - =/Users/gcr/Downloads=
  - =/Users/gcr/Dropbox=
  - =/Users/gcr/tmp=
  - =/Users/gcr/.vagrant.d/boxes=
    - [[http://docs-v1.vagrantup.com/v1/docs/boxes.html][Reference]]
    - How this works is that when CCC cloned that disk image back to the machine,
      this directory was present, and it was empty. I was curious about whether
      the directory would be present or not and happy to see it was.
    - After upping a box successfully, I verified that the base box was
      installed here as expected
  - =/VirtualBox VMs=
    - VirtualBox stores its VMS here by default
    - When you start making changes to a Vagrant box, they are saved [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8225820/where-is-vagrant-saving-changes-to-the-vm][here]]
    - For example I booted up the Vagrant box from "Getting started", created a
      hello world file, logged out and halted it, and this directory was
      =tmp_default_1426807980079_94539= was created in there and it contained all
      of the .vbox stuff for that machine.
      - Verified that =vagrant destroy= deletes that directory
  - =/Users/gcr/Documents/Virtual Machines=
    - http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/search.do?cmd=displayKC&docType=kc&docTypeID=DT_KB_1_1&externalId=2056798
    - This seems to be the directory where VMWare creates machines when you do
      so through the GUI
  - When Vagrant VMWare Fusion creates machines it creates them inside of a
    =.vagrant= directory where the Vagrantfile lives.
      - The path is =<directory where the Vagrant file lives>/.vagrant/machines/default/vmware_fusion=
      - Found this info [[https://blog.safaribooksonline.com/2014/01/16/building-vagrant-vms-with-the-vmware-fusion-provider/][here]] and verified it on my machine
      - Verified that =vagrant destroy= deletes that directory
- Make sure that this configuration, including Kitchenplan, is tagged
- Note that tag here:
  - Machine name
  - Built from image
  - Provisioning Tag
  - Timestamp
  - c02M-01-v1.7-2015-03-17T18:58:40-0500
- On successful creation of the new image
  - Erase the machine and clone the new image to it
    - Address any image restoration issues now
  - Backup this new image to Stargate
  - Copy thse Dropbox folder
