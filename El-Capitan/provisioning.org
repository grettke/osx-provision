* Goal

** Desire

- To quickly and easily
  - Explore cognitive spaces using operating systems and software
  - Try, fail, learn, improve, and repeat
  - For expensive operations measured in time and complexity
    - Minimize their execution time
      - Central Processing Unit (CPU)
      - Input/Output (IO)
    - Rebound from failure
  - Share

** Satisfaction

- First-class support for OS X, Windows, Linux and all of their software
- Manage machines as easily and flexibly as you would with version control
- Use the fastest devices possible for every operation
- First class operating system image management
- Virtual machines (VM)

** Decision

- Current:
  - Macintosh Computer (Mac)
  - OS X
  - VMWare Fusion Professional
- With /Best/:
  - Solid State Disk (SSD)
  - RAM
  - CPU count and speed

* Preparation

** External Drive

Get a 7200RPM 1TB external disk drive with USB3 or Lightning.

Create a partition named =Storage= that is at least 100GB. The =EXT:= naming
convention is to indicate that it lives on an external device. This is helpful
to make sense of partitions there versus on the Macintosh HD. That is not part
of the name of the partition itself. I'll use that naming also to indicate
computers that contain a single disk drive.

** Software
*** Carbon Copy Cloner (CCC)

[[https://bombich.com/][Purchase]] the latest version that supports El Capitan. Download it along with the
license to =EXT:Storage=. Install it on the =Support Computer=.
*** VMWare Fusion

[[https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion][Purchase]] a copy and download it to =EXT:Storage=. Download your license key.

** Support Computer

Keep a working Mac nearby. You will use it to work with the contents of
your Git repositories, research configuration steps, and rest easy knowing that
you've always got a working machine.

Make sure that it has Internet access and download all of your Git repositories
required for configuring these machines.

Don't try use your host computer for this role by booting it to an external
drive; it is too easy to confuse partitions and what you are doing.

Use CCC to clone this Mac's partition, =Support:Macintosh HD=, to a partition on
=EXT=. The easiest thing to do is to connect =EXT=
to =Support Computer=. Create a new partition big enough to hold it and perform
the clone. Name it =EXT:Utility=. Reboot to it to test it.

** Host Computer

- Collect the Pristine Host Operating System Image (PHOSI)
  - Pristine means that it has never been logged into or configured
  - Has the latest OS X on it with at least the second fix pack or later
  - Verify that it contains Recovery Partition for that OS X on the disk
    - If the imaging takes less than 10 minutes then they didn't include the
      Recovery Partition
  - You can easily get this from an appointment at the Genius Bar
- Create the Pristine Host Operating System Disk Image (PHOSDI)
  - Take your Mac home
  - Boot from =EXT:Utility=
  - Use CCC
    - From the host computer's =PHOSI=, =Host:Macintosh HD=
    - To
      - A new =PHOSDI=; *read-only* and *compressed* disk image
      - Located on =EXT:Storage=
    - Execute the imaging task
- Test =PHOSDI=
  - Boot into =Host:Macintosh HD=, configure it
  - Boot into =EXT:Support= and re-image =Host:Macintosh HD= from =PHOSDI=
  - Boot into =Host:Macintosh HD=
    - It should appear pristine, you need to enter all of the installation
      information again. This will be re-imaged again soon so don't worry
      about this.
  - Copy =EXT:Storage PHOSDI= to =Host:Storage=
- Create the =Host:Utility= partition using =PHOSDI=
  - Boot into =EXT:Support=
  - Create 1 new partition on =Host=, named =Utility=: 16GB
    - Now there are 3: =Macintosh HD=, =Support=, and =Utility=
  - Use CCC to clone =PHOSDI= to =Host:Support=
  - Verify that you can
    - Boot into =Host:Support=
    - Install CCC
    - Access the =Storage= partition
      - CCC images
      - Disk images
      - Software
      - Scripts

* Host Configuration

** Starting Point

- Image your machine using =PHOSDI=

** Manual Steps

Steps unique to the host are indicated.

- During configuration personalize/configure/install nothing
- Host :: Maximize resolution
- Make a user named =sysop=, System Operator
- Show Keychain Access in Menubar
- Screensaver: Flurry, 10m
- Host :: Add printer
- Host :: Bluetooth mouse
- Speedup mouse
- Energy saver: non-aggressive, never sleep
- Swap control keys
- Install Spectacle, allow, start at boot
- Host :: Install Karabiner, allow, start at boot, return once sends option
- Host :: Install VMWare Fusion Professional
